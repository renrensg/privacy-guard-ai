# Project Proposal: Prevent Privacy Leakage in Using Generative AI

## Problem Statement
Generative AI systems often leak private data (emails, phone numbers, IDs, GPS metadata).  
This project ensures safe AI usage by redacting sensitive information before it is sent.

## Objectives
1. Detect Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
2. Redact or replace sensitive data with pseudonyms.
3. Strip EXIF metadata from images.
4. Provide restore functionality so users can recover original data locally.

## Expected Deliverables
- A working Python program.
- Sample test cases (text + image).
- Final report and demo video.
